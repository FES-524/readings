# Nested versus crossed factors

Last week we saw examples of crossed factors with the factorial designs, this week we will see both *nested* and crossed factors.

## Crossed factors

Recall from last week that when we have crossed factors, all combinations of the levels of the factors are present in the study. Figure \@ref(fig:crossed) shows a diagram of crossed factors of "school" with two levels, and "teacher" with three levels. All teachers taught at each school in this example.

```{r crossed, fig.cap="Diagram of two crossed factors, one with two levels and the other with three."}
knitr::include_graphics(here("images/crossed_diagram.png"))
```

## Nested factors

When one factor is *nested* in another, levels of one factor occur only within one specific level of another factor.  In Figure \@ref(fig:nested), the diagram shows teachers nested in schools. We can see that teachers 1 and 2 only taught at school 1 and teacher 3 only taught at school 2.

```{r nested, fig.cap="Diagram of a factor, teacher, nested in the school factor."}
knitr::include_graphics(here("images/nested_diagram.png"))
```

## Partial crossing

In partial crossing, levels of one factor occur with more than one level of another factor.  However, not all levels of one factor occur with every level of another factor like in full crossing.  This can happen when, for example, a teacher switches schools during the time frame of a study.  In the example schematic below, you can see that teacher 2 taught in both school 1 and school 2 while the other two teachers only taught in one school.  These factors are partially crossed.


### Crossed random effects

Being able to recognize crossed versus nested factors can be important when those factors are to be treated as random. We will not see any crossed random effects in this class, but a common example of crossed random effects is when working with space-time studies, where multiple study units were measured across time.  Having both time (e.g., year) and space (e.g., plot) factors that you want to treat as random effects often indicates you need a model that allows for crossed random effects. All of the issues of crossed random effects come up with partial crossing, which is why you need to be able to recognize if the factors you are using as random effects are partially crossed.

# Studies with different sizes of physical units

This week we will be focusing on study designs where there are different sizes of physical units within the same study.  Sometimes having different sizes of physical units is due to sub-sampling, such as the designs we saw in week 2, and we can average over the smallest physical units to simplify the analysis.  However, this week our examples will have different factors of interest measured on or applied to physical units of different sizes.

One term you will see for studies like the ones we will see this week, coming from experimental design language, is *split plot*.  The examples this week are actually examples of *blocked split plot designs*.  However, it is unnecessary to use this sort of jargon to describe a study.  It is better practice to clearly describe the study design so anyone can understand what was done without using this statistical jargon.  Even if you do include this kind of language, which is common in some fields, make sure you still thoroughly describe the design rather than relying on this terminology. 

## Explicit versus implicit naming

A common issue when working with factors from different sized physical units, where smaller-sized units are nested in larger-sized units, is to have *implicitely named* factors. However, this can cause confusion. Is plant 3 at site 1 the same as plant 3 at site 2? It is difficult to tell by just looking at the dataset, and a R will not be able to tell that these are two unique plants.  This kind of implicit naming is relatively common, but it makes it more difficult to figure out all the sources of variation that need to be included in a model.

```{r eg-data}
df <- data.frame(
    site = rep(1:3, each = 6),
    plant = rep(rep(1:3, each = 2), 3),
    treatment = rep(c("hand pollen", "open pollen"), 9)
)

kableExtra::kable(
    df,
    format = "latex",
    booktabs = T,
    caption = "Example dataset with implicite naming for plants within sites."
)
```


You can see an example of this in Table \@ref(tab:eg-data), showing a “watershed” variable plus the two factors of interest in the motivating example for two of the study watersheds.  Stands are the replicate physical unit for the overstory factor, but there is no stand variable in the dataset.

Is the stand that represents RA in watershed A the same as the one that represents RA in watershed B?  It is difficult to tell by just looking at the dataset, and a computer won’t be able to tell that these are two unique stands.  This kind of implicit naming is relatively common, but it makes it more difficult to figure out all the sources of variation that need to be included in a model.


## Making explicit names

I recommend keeping the physical units as distinct variables from the other factors in the dataset.  This will make models (and the dataset) easier to understand.  To do this we need to create explicit names for the physical units in the study.

Making explicit names is often most straightforward to do during data collection.  For example, plants could have been given unique identifiers that were entered in the dataset along with the other collected data.  If we didn't do that, though, we can still create unique names using the other factors in the dataset.

In Table \@ref(tab:eg-data), there was no variable to represent the different plants.  If we have a description of the study design, though, we would know that each plant within a site is unique.  To make unique names for plants, we can combine the site and plant columns. In Table \@ref(tab:eg-data2), it is much easier to see that plant 1 within site 1 is different from plant 1 in site 2 because observations from different sites are associated with unique plant identifiers.

```{r eg-data2}
df <- df %>% mutate(
    plant_id = paste(site, plant, sep = "_"),
    .before = treatment
)

kableExtra::kable(
    df,
    format = "latex",
    booktabs = T,
    caption = "Example dataset with a unique plant identifier."
)
```


# Statistical model and analysis

You will see that the statistical model in Lab 5 is starting to get pretty complicated.  The focus of this week is on the additional random effects.

## Nested random effects

When we have nested physical units in a study we have more sources of variation that affect the response variable that we (usually) are not specifically interested in.  These factors are part of the design and must be accounted for in any model.  If we leave any of these out of the model used for analysis after designing a study with different sizes of physical units, we will not meet the assumption of independence of errors.
